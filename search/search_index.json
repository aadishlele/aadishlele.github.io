Our project is basically a spinning top with a HMI that will be able to control speed and direction of our spinning top. I will be using the PIC to ensure that when data and power are supplied, it runs and is able to balance itself on the ground. For this it is very essential for me to get the speed and direction of the motor right as that will smoothen the further process of sending that data to the ESP32 module. I am responsible for actuation using the motor and the motor driver.</p> <p></p> <p>Microcontroller Rationale: The PIC18F27Q10 is an excellent choice for our spinning top project because of its high-performance 8-bit architecture and varied peripherals. It uses efficient motor control With PWM modules and can use the Adafruit motor for its precise control.It also uses low power consumption and can help saving power for other subsytems. It also includes UART/SPi/I2C communication protocols and interfaces for interacting with the motor and motor driver. It supports ADC fro impementing Gyroscopes for motion control and balace which is another subsytem of our project. These features make the PIC18F27Q10 a power-efficient, and scalable microcontroller for ensuring smooth operation and precise control with PWMs.</p>"},{"location":"Schematic/","title":"Schematic","text":""},{"location":"Schematic/#schemaic-design-of-motor-driver-subsystem","title":"Schemaic design of Motor driver Subsystem","text":"<p>EGR314 Aadish Lele SchematicEGR314_Schematic.pdf</p> <p>EGR314 Aadish lele Schematic zip EGR314_Schematic (28-02-2025 22-20-39).zip</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#beautiful-math-in-all-browsers","title":"Beautiful math in all browsers","text":"<p>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.
