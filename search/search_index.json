The driver can operate at PWM frequencies up to 20kHz, which is above the audible range for humans. The IFX9201SGAUMA1 is not qualified for automotive applications. The device lacks built-in reverse polarity protection, requiring external circuitry to safeguard against incorrect power supply connections. 2  Option 2: 48-V, 3.5-A H BRIDGE MOTOR DRIVE  Texas Instruments Price: $1.79/unit Option 2 Link Wide Voltage Range (3.3V\u201348V)  - supports many motors. Provides up to 4A-5A peak current for controlling larger motors. Only controls one motor, so additional drivers are needed for multi-motor applications. Does not have a PWM module, meaning an external PWM control is required. Cannot be used for stepper motors or other complex motor types. 3  Option 3: IC MOTOR DRIVER UNIPOLAR 8SO POWERPAD  Texas Instruments Price: $2.13/unit Option 3 Link High Current Output (Up to 3.6A Peak) \u2013 Able to drive medium-power DC motors. Wide Voltage Range (6.5V\u201345V) \u2013 Supports a broad range of DC motors. At high currents, may require a heatsink or proper PCB design to avoid shorting or fire. Not compatible with I2C or SPI interface which is the communication protocol for this project. <p>Final Choice: Option 1 Rationale: The Infineon Technology IFX9201SGAUMA1 is my choice for controlling the DC motor in the spinning motor top project because of its precise speed control, low power consumption, and compact design. It also inculcates I2C protocol and low voltage as power.Moreover, it has a compact design and is very lightweight.</p> <ol> <li>Motor</li> </ol> No. Solution Pros Cons 1  Option 1: STANDARD MOTOR 9100 RPM 6V Adafruit Industries Price: $1.95/unit Option Link Datasheet Link Provides a stable 10W power supply, making it suitable for advanced microcontrollers like PIC. Small in size and can fit physically into small systems. Standard 5.5mm outer  DC plug ensures connections and compatibility with other electronic ports. Fixed at 5V, so we may need a Voltage regulator to get 5V. Cannot connect to USB Voltage regulators 2  Option 2: STANDARD MOTOR 12850 RPM 6V NMB Technologies Price: $5.22/unit Option 2 Link Produced by NMB Technologies, known for long lifespan in industry. Ideal for electronic cooling surfaces Is not compatible for control neither by PWM or Voltage  Will require detailed soldering instead of adapted connections 3  Option 3: STANDARD MOTOR 6960 RPM 12V Seeed Technologies Price: $5.22/unit Option 3 Link Compatible with 30V - 250V ADC Uses a groove connector easy to connect to Arduino Digikey discontinued its production Has a limited lifespan over other options <p>Final Choice: Option 1 Rationale: The Adafruit motor provides consistent torque, stable power supply of 10W, and reliable performance and it works excellent with PIC microcontrollers. Its compact design and efficiency make it ideal for installing it into small handheld devices like a motor based spinning top which is the main inspiration of our project.</p> <ol> <li>Voltage Regulator</li> </ol> No. Solution Pros Cons 1  Option 1: AP63203WU-7  Diodes Incorporated Price: $1.38/unit Option Link Datasheet Reduces heat dissipation and power loss Requires minimal additional components, simplifying circuit design and PCB layout. Fixed 3.3V Output \u2013 Not adjustable, which limits flexibility if different voltages are needed. 2  Option 2:  MIC5158YM-TR Price: $5.66/unit Option 2 Link More pins offer more GPIO functionality Can support wide range of voltage regulation Difficult to solder. Expensive than other voltage regulators. 3  Option 3:  MIC5156-3.3YM  Price: $4.02/unit Option 3 Link Supports High Current Loads for transistors and SMDS Ensures efficient operation with minimal voltage loss. Difficult to Solder Requires External Components <p>Final Choice: Option 1 Rationale: The AP63203Wu-7 offers 90% efficiency, 6.5V\u201340V input range, and 1A output. The stable 3.3V regulation with minimal heat dissipation is consistent in the IC. It has a  low component count, and built-in thermal and overcurrent protection for reliability.</p> <ol> <li>Power Supply</li> </ol> No. Solution Pros Cons 1  Option 1: 9V rechargeable 13000mAH battery  LCLEBM Price: $11.98/2 unit Option Link Ideal for portable electronics and has a small factor and 1200mAh capacity. Rechargeable for longer utility May not power sufficiently for high usage devices. Will require manual soldering 2  Option 2:  L6R06H-240  Tri-Mag LLC Price: $5.31/unit Option 2 Link Supports 90V-240V input with a excellent output voltage of 24V.

In this setup, the motor functions as an actuator, and my goal is to demonstrate how changes in temperature values can be used to control and alter the motor's direction. The PCB uses UART communication to receive and transmit data from the temperature sensor PCB. Based on the received temperature values, it actuates the motor accordingly, adjusting its direction to reflect temperature changes.</p> <p>Requirements: I2C Communication Protocol to be implemented for communication between the PIC18F27Q10 microcontroller and the Temperature Sensor.
