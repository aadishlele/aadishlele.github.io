The Motor Driver PCB Block Diagram icludes 4 main compartments namely - Connections, Motor driver and PIC18F47Q10. The motor driver has two output pins that are connected to the motor and two pins that communicate to the PIC via SPI. The PIC has two UARt pins (RX and TX) which connect to the ribbon cables. The Connector IN ribbon cable has the RX pin and the Connector OUt pin has the TX pin. There are also 4 SPI pins connected to the motor driver which are Chip Select (CSN), Serial Clock (SCK), Serial Input (SI) and Serial Output (SO).
