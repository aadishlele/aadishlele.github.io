## Hello, I am Aadish Lele  

I am part of Team 309A in EGR 314. Our main porject is making a spinning top that will change direction based upon temperature values. When the temperature increases beyond a certain threshold, the spinning top motor will change the direction and move counter clockwise. This system is designed to inspire K-12 students to learn and understand how sensor values changes the way actuators function.
